# Reaction Counter for Facebook LIVE streams.

This is a Javascript based Facebook Live tool you can use to drive live interactions with your facebook content using digital broadcasting software that supports webpage layers, such as Open Broadcast Studio (https://obsproject.com/)

This will count the reactions on any public live video post

Demo here:
https://facebook-livevoting.herokuapp.com/

To customize your own, clone this repo to your host. Then make a facebook app and get an ID (https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register). Put your app ID on line 1 of the javascript, my app ID only works for the demo domain!. Customize the CSS file to your liking! 

I recommend authorizing the app in a regular browser. After you authorize the app, just run it as a layer in Open Broadcast Software over your video content (you might have to log-in to facebook again in the OBS bowser. The OBS browser does not support pop-ups, so you need to go to facebook.com first to login)

Feel free to fork and improve.
