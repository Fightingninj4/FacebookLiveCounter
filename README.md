# Facebook_Reaction_Voting


This is a simples Javascript based Facebook Live voting tool you can use to drive live interactions with your facebook content.

This will count the votes on any public live video post

Demo here:
https://facebook-livevoting.herokuapp.com/

To customize your own, all you need to do is make a facebook app ID, put in your hosting information on developer.facebook.com, and customize the CSS file. Put your app ID on line 1 of the javascript!

After you authorize the app, just run it as a layer in Open Broadcast Software over your video content.

Feel free to fork and improve.
